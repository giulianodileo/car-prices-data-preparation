# ðŸš— Car Price Data Preparation

### Overview
This repository contains a complete preprocessing workflow for a car-price dataset.
The goal is to ensure the data is clean, consistent, and suitable for machine-learning modeling.
All preprocessing steps are implemented in a single, reproducible notebook.

---

### Workflow Summary
The notebook follows a structured approach to data cleaning and preparation:

1. **Duplicate Removal** â€“ eliminate repeated records to prevent data leakage.
2. **Missing Data Treatment** â€“ detect, analyze, and handle missing values through selective imputation.
3. **Outlier Inspection** â€“ visualize distributions to identify unrealistic values before scaling.
4. **Feature Scaling** â€“ normalize numerical features using `RobustScaler` or `StandardScaler` according to their distribution.
5. **Categorical Encoding** â€“ transform text variables into numeric form using:
   - One-Hot Encoding (`aspiration`, `enginelocation`, `enginetype`)
   - Manual Ordinal Encoding (`cylindernumber`)
   - Label Encoding for the target (`price`)
6. **Feature Selection** â€“ apply permutation importance to retain only the most relevant predictors (`curbweight`, `carwidth`).

The notebook concludes with a clean dataset ready for modeling and further analysis.
